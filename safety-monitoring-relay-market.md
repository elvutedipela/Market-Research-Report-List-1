<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Monitoring Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open</li><li>Normally Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The safety monitoring relay market is categorized into two main types: Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) relays. Normally Open relays are unpowered in their default state, closing the circuit when activated, which ensures that a fault condition leads to an immediate interruption of the circuit, enhancing safety. Conversely, Normally Closed relays maintain a closed circuit by default, opening when activated, providing continuous monitoring. Both types are crucial for machinery safety, preventing unintended operations and ensuring compliance with safety standards.</p></p>
