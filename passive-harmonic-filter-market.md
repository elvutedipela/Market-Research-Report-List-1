<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive Harmonic Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tuned Passive Harmonic Filter</li><li>De-tuned Passive Harmonic Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passive harmonic filter market features two primary types: tuned and de-tuned filters. Tuned passive harmonic filters are designed to target specific harmonic frequencies, effectively reducing harmonic distortion in electrical systems by absorbing unwanted frequencies. In contrast, de-tuned passive harmonic filters prevent resonance with system impedances by shifting the tuned frequency away from the dominant harmonics, which helps maintain system stability and performance. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing power quality and compliance with regulatory standards.</p></p>
